One of the scariest parts of this machine is the original power cord.

Interestingly, the hot lead was twisted together with another wire and soldered to the back of the power outlet on the amp... while completely ignoring the screw terminal.

So the new cord went in with the fused side soldered (like the original cord was) and the other using the screw terminal.

Powered it up and definitely it's producing a loud hum... so an amp rebuild may be in the near future.

The upside this week is that the LED replacements for the fluorescent bulbs look GREAT!
