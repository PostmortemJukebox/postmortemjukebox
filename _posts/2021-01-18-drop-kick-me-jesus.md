Finally got the Wurlitzer moved upstairs and while assessing the work, a message from beyond appeared:

...which sorta describes my feeling after looking around inside

The "Top Tunes" button is definitely dead.

...due in large part to the fact that the mechanism is hanging out the back of the jukebox. 

This is broken and needs replacing anyway (notice the fractured PCB)

The amplifier is positively filthy. Getting this gross thing clean and tested is at the top of the list.

A full view of the back of the filthy animal.

Fortnuately, Ebay seems to have a good selection of parts for this machine, and the manuals can be obtained for a fair price.
