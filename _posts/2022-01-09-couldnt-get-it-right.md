## Trim Package

The trim on the front of the jukebox is really the most contact-prone surface on the whole thing. The jukebox arrived with one piece of side trim barely hanging on, and the other was completely missing.

I used [Tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com) to create a model of a cross-section of the trim, and a model of the end cap that fits under the keyboard casting.

[You can find the model files here](https://github.com/PostmortemJukebox/3d_assets/tree/main/front_trim)

With any luck, I'll be able to find a fabrication shop that can re-create these trim pieces.
