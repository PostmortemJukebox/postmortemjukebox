Two problems addressed, one of which was substantially easier than the other.

First problem: The #1 selection button was stuck. _Really_ stuck. The more of this beast I disassemble, the more I'm impressed by the amount of grit and grime that these intricate machines can carry and still operate. The #1 switch underneath the button was corroded in place, which evidently crossed the threshold of how much the mechanism could take before becoming inoperable.

After loosening and vacuuming the debris away from the switches, and lubricating and working the switch for a few minutes, the switch became functional once again.

Second problem: When a song selection was made and the carousel spun around to align the right record for loading, and the selector tip lodged against the latch pin, and the entire mechanism would freeze. The arms with selector tips attached should strike the pin, and as the shaft continues to turn, a switch is activated which causes the motor to briefly reverse direction (relieving the pressure) and then the tip pushes the pin down and the record is loaded for playing. There's a red relay on the side of the junction box, which is responsible for reversing the direction of the carousel, and the one that was in place had the cover removed and was terribly corroded. Why the previous owner (before my grandmother acquired it) decided to remove the cover from the relays is beyond my understanding. The photo below has the original relay on top, and the replacement relay, minus the cap. The cap was reattached to the clean one and it was installed on the side of the junction box, and the selector issue was resolved.

Next up: Nearly everything is tested and working... except for the amplifier. The amp has a loud 60hz tone being produced, which is either a faulty tube or a bad filter capacitor. Gonna test tubes next, and a recapping may be in order...
