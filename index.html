	<h1>A wild Wurlitzer appears...</h1>
    <p>My grandmother was an expert at spotting deals at yard sales and flea markets.</p>
    <p>One of her better acquisitions was a Wurlitzer 2710, in somewhat questionable shape.</p>
    <p>This project will follow the restoration or outright hacking of this Wurlitzer 2710. Ideally, it'll end up near original shape.</p>
    <p>There's an outside chance that this'll get weird and it may end up with new guts and a few new features...</p>
